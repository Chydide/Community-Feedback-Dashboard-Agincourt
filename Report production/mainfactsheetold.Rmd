## *`r name` village population `r as.numeric(params$year) + 1`*

The numbers shown below are calculated according to numbers for the end of June `r as.numeric(params$year) + 1`. The numbers are known as mid-year population figures.

<center>

```{r echo = FALSE}
#library(stargazer)
kable(table1) 

```

<center>

Below you can see how many people were living in `r name` of different ages in June `r as.numeric(params$year)+ 1`.

```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}

kable(table2)
```

Below you can see the population structure of `r name` for `r as.numeric(params$year)+ 1`.  

```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis', warning = FALSE}
 fig_1 <- fig1 %>%
        rename(Male = MalePop, Female = FemalePop) %>%
        gather(key = Gender, value = Population, -c(Years, VillNo, PoliticalVillage, Ordered,AgeGroup, MidYearPop))%>%
    mutate(Population = replace(Population,Gender=="Male",-Population))

ggplot(fig_1, aes(x =Ordered, y = Population, fill = Gender)) +

                           title = element_text(color = "gray25"),
                           plot.caption = element_text(color = "gray30"),
                           plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12))
```

##  *Births*

### *Number of Births by Sex*
The number of births recorded in `r name` are shown below. We can only provide data to the end of `r params$year`. 

```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
kable(table3)
```




### *Crude Birth Rate (how many babies born for every one thousand people)*

The graph below shows the crude birth rates in `r name` in `r params$year`. 

```{r echo = FALSE, warning =FALSE, out.width = "80%"}

ggplot(fig2, aes(x= factor(Years) , y= CrudeRate)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.3) +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Crude Birth Rate per 1000"
  ) +
  theme_classic()+
  theme(legend.title.align=0.5) +
                     theme(legend.box =  "horizontal",
                           text = element_text(family = "Bookman"),
                           title = element_text(color = "gray25"),
                           plot.caption = element_text(color = "gray30"),
                           plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12))
```

The crude birth rate is found by comparing the number of babies born to the total population.  For every 1 000 people (all ages and both male and female) living in `r name` in the year of `r params$year`, `r floor(fig2$CrudeRate)` babies were born.

### *Births by Mother's Age and Age Specific Fertility Rates*

Research within the MRC/Wits-Agincourt Unit HDSS study area continues to look closely at fertility.  You can see the number of babies born to mothers of different ages in the study area in `r params$year` below.

```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
kable(table100)
```


The age specific fertility rates of `r name` in `r params$year` are shown below. 

```{r echo = FALSE, warning =FALSE, out.width = "80%"}

ggplot(table4, aes(x= AgeGroup , y= ASFR*1000))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.3)+
  labs(
    x = "Age group",
    y = "Age-specific fertility rate per 1000 women"
  ) +
  theme_classic()+
  theme(legend.title.align=0.5) +
                     theme(legend.box =  "horizontal",
                           text = element_text(family = "Bookman"),
                           title = element_text(color = "gray25"),
                           plot.caption = element_text(color = "gray30"),
                           plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12))
```


We find the age specific fertility rate by looking at how many women in a certain age group have had babies in a certain year. For example, we can see that in `r params$year`, for the women in the age group 15-19, `r floor(table4$ASFR[table4$AgeGroup == "15-19"] * 1000)` out of every 1000 gave birth (if there had been over 1000 living in `r name`. 

\pagebreak

## *Deaths*
Below you can see the total number of deaths that occurred in the `r name` in `r params$year`. 

```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
kable(table5)
```

Below you can see the total number of death that occurred in the `r name` in `r params$year`.


```{r echo = FALSE, warning =FALSE, out.width = "80%"}

ggplot(fig3, aes(x= factor(Years) , y= CrudeRate))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.3)+
  labs(
    x = 'Year',
    y = 'Crude Death Rate per 1000'
  ) +
  theme_classic()+
  theme(legend.title.align=0.5) +
                     theme(legend.box =  "horizontal",
                           text = element_text(family = "Bookman"),
                           title = element_text(color = "gray25"),
                           plot.caption = element_text(color = "gray30"),
                           plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12))

```


The crude death rate is found by looking at how many people died for every 1 000 people living in the population.  In `r params$year`, for every 1 000 people in the population of `r name`, `r floor(fig3$CrudeRate)` died. 


\pagebreak

##  *Migration*
**Permanent migration patterns**

Below you can see how many people have moved into and out of `r name` permanently for the year of `r params$year`. 

```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
kable(table6)

```


```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
kable(table7)

```
